<h1>Unspoken with Synthizer</h1>
<p>Unspoken is an add-on which was originally created by Austin Hicks (Camlorn), which plays sounds in 3D to represent controls on the screen rather than speaking control types with speech.</p>
<p>This is a version of Unspoken that works with the Python 3 versions of NVDA and uses Synthizer.</p>
