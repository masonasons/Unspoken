# Unspoken with Synthizer
## Note! Add-on discontinued
This add-on has been replaced by the new [Unspoken-NG add-on from Fastfinge.](https://github.com/fastfinge/unspoken-ng)

Unspoken is an add-on which was originally created by Austin Hicks (Camlorn), which plays sounds in 3D to represent controls on the screen rather than speaking control types with speech.

This is a version of Unspoken that works with the Python 3 (Upto 3.11) versions of NVDA and uses Synthizer. NVDA 2025.1 and below.
